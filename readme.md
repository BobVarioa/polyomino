# Todo
- [ ] Gamemodes
	- [ ] Monomino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Tetris Attack](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Attack)?
			- [Bejeweled]()
		- [ ] Cursor that can swap pieces
		- [ ] Clears should generate new rows, can't top out from anything but garbage
	- [ ] Domino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Dr. Mario](https://tetris.wiki/Dr._Mario)?
			- [Puyo Puyo]()
		- [ ] 
	- [ ] Tromino
		- Inspiration:
			- None (as of yet)
		- Ideas:
			- Color matching? The main problem, and why I scraped Columns as an idea, is that it is vastly different to how any of the other games function. Plus, Columns (and match-3 as a whole) isn't really that fun in long sessions
			- Something about manipulating the board instead of your pieces? 
	- [ ] Tetromino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Tetris](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline)
		- [x] Guildline rules
			- [x] All Tetrominos
			- [x] Rotation: SRS
			- [x] Lock delay: 0.5s
			- [~] Piece preview
			- [~] Hold box
			- [x] Bag randomizer
			- [ ] Levels
			- [ ] Scoring
		- I'm pretty sure that's all I want for this one, but maybe some gimmick could be interesting? 
	- [ ] Pentomino
		- Inspiration:
			- Pentomino modes in jstris, Puyo Puyo Tetris, and various tetris fangames
		- [x] All non mirrored pentominos
		- [~] Add a new rotation system based on SRS
			- [x] Flipping
			- [ ] Look into nullpomino's rotation system editor to fix the bugs, because doing this by hand is painful
		- [ ] Scoring
			- [ ] Look into which pieces should give spin bonuses
			- [ ] Line clears should be initally less, but multiple line clears should be more due to their difficulty
	- [ ] Polyomino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Puyo Puyo Tetris: Party](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Party)
			- [Tetris Effect Conected: Zone](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Effect#Zone_mechanic)
			- [Pac-Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Attack)
		- [ ] Special Effects
			- These should **never** be able to be purchased with real money 
			- No lootboxes, etc.
			- [ ] Characters
				- Inspiration:
					- [TETR.IO](https://characters.osk.sh/) 
					- Puyo Puyo Characters
				- In general, things that change gameplay throughout the whole match
				- [ ] Something like [Hot Wax](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=146729)? 
					- Fires would come every X bags, no candle bombs 
					- The same wax piece mechanics 
					- More fires burning continously on your side would mean more garbage 
				- [ ] Something that involves player movement on the board
					- Player could be crushed by blocks, but could do something to clear them
					- Blocks would increase in speed much more rapidly
				- [ ] Making garbage you send *weird*
					- [ ] Multi hole garbage
					- [ ] Garbage which requires some condition?
					- [ ] 
			- [ ] Active abilities
				- By pressing the [Ability] key, these will be activated
				- Generally these require a charge meter of some sort, the specific action required will depend 
				- [x] Zone
				- [x] Filling holes
				- [ ] Changes your hold box into a special mino
					- [ ] Fairies, removes n lines of garbage 
					- [ ] Bomb, removes all tiles in an area
					- [ ] Sword, clears all minos in a direction
				- [ ] Send garbage to opponent but ... to you
					- [ ] Double back?
					- [ ] Unclearable garbage?
				- [ ] 
		- [ ] Allows different players to play different gamemodes against each other, i.e. a duo and a tetra player
		- [ ] Players should be able to have loadouts of characters / active abilities
