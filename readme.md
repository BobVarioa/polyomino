# Todo / Design Doc

- [ ] Gamemodes
	- [ ] Monomino
    	- Idea 1:
    		- Inspiration:
    			- [Tetris Attack/Panel de Pon](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Attack)?
    			- General match-3 mechanics
    		- [ ] Cursor that can swap pieces
    		- [ ] Generating new pieces
        		- [ ] Clears generate new pieces, can't top out from anything but garbage?
        		- [ ] Manual send pieces button?
        		- [ ] Screen is forced to be full of pieces?
    		- [ ] Random replace garbage
    		- General problem: match-3 is not really that fun in long sessions, and most definitely has a pretty low skill ceiling
		- Idea 2:
    		- Inspiration:
        		- [Stackitect](https://farly.itch.io/stackitect)
        		- [C::Reactris](https://hdms.itch.io/c4r)
      		- [ ] Blocks with special abilities that interact in dynamic ways
        		- [ ] Rest`ricted placement mechanics
        		- [ ] Mainipulating the playfield (pushing blocks, creating new blocks, destroying them, etc.)
        		- [ ] Special clear mechanics (if near X block and Y block, destroy this one)
        		- [ ] Liquids? (this works in C::Reactris because there's proper tetraminos with this ability, unsure how this would work with monominos)
      		- [ ] C::Reactris has a concept of weather and a day night cycle, so perhaps a similar global style effect
      		- [ ] Stackitect has a selection screen that lets them choose which blocks to get next, perhaps something where you manipulate the pieces in your queue
      		- General problems: 
        		- This would be very gimmicky, and I kinda wanna keep that stuff in a polyomino mode/character? 
        		- This would be either really simple or really complex strategy-wise (there is one correct way to play / essentially random)
        		- Too relient on RNG
  		- Idea 3:
    		- Inspiration:
        		- [Elementris](https://mayzavan.itch.io/elementris)
        		- [Tactris](https://nofowl.itch.io/tactris)
      		- [ ] Reversed board gravity (pieces come from bottom and go up)
      		- [x] Linear gravity 
      		- [ ] Garbage comes from the top and slowly sinks down
        		- [ ] Garbage will be tiered in how many clears it takes to remove (think Puyo Puyo)
        		- [ ] Garbage will be generated at a faster rate per level, and steadly take more hits to remove
        		- [ ] Enemy garbage will be additional to your normal steady garbage 
      		- [ ] Each monomino has a special ability that will clear an area
        		- [ ] Bomb-type ability that clears garbage in a 5x5 under (over) it
        		- [ ] Blocking garbage from rising
        		- [ ] Moving garbage
        		- [ ] Digging holes through garbage]
      		- [ ] Minos are activated whenever they touch three other minos
    		- General problems:
        		- Conveying to the player what each piece does without tutorializing it, the other gamemodes make this pretty easy
        		- Limited complexity, for example, in Elementris, a winning strategy is just to spam pieces
            		- No rotation, potenially addressable by allowing the player to "aim" the pieces
            		- Limited combo or set up potenial
	- [ ] Domino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Dr. Mario](https://tetris.wiki/Dr._Mario)?
			- [Puyo Puyo](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Tsu_(rule))
		- [x] Multicolor pieces that clear based on the color
		- [x] Linear gravity
		- [ ] Falling garbage
	- [ ] Tromino
		- Inspiration:
			- None (as of yet)
		- Ideas:
			- Color matching? Problem: Too similar to domino, no idea how to make it more interesting
			- Something about manipulating the board instead of your pieces? 
    			- [Pipe Tetris?](https://alphageneric.itch.io/pipe-tetris)
	- [ ] Tetromino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Tetris](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline)
		- [x] Guildline rules
			- [x] All Tetrominos
			- [x] Rotation: SRS
			- [x] Lock delay: 0.5s
			- [x] Piece preview
			- [x] Hold box
			- [x] Bag randomizer
			- [ ] Levels
			- [ ] Garbage
	- [ ] Pentomino
		- Inspiration:
			- Pentomino modes in jstris, Puyo Puyo Tetris, and various tetris fangames
		- [x] All non mirrored pentominos
		- [~] Add a new rotation system based on SRS
			- [x] Flipping
			- [ ] Look into nullpomino's rotation system editor to fix the bugs, because doing this by hand is painful
		- [ ] Garbage
			- [ ] Look into which pieces should give spin bonuses
			- [ ] Line clears should be initally less, but multiple line clears should be more due to their difficulty
	- [ ] Polyomino
		- Inspiration:
			- [Puyo Puyo Tetris: Party](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Party)
			- [Tetris Effect Conected: Zone](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Effect#Zone_mechanic)
			- [Pac-Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Attack)
		- [ ] Special Effects
			- These are obtained via an XP like system, or maybe an ingame currency to give more agency to the player
			- [ ] Characters
				- Inspiration:
					- [TETR.IO](https://characters.osk.sh/) 
					- Puyo Puyo Characters
				- In general, things that change gameplay throughout the whole match
				- [ ] Something like [Hot Wax](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=146729)? 
					- Fires would come every X bags, no candle bombs 
					- The same wax piece mechanics 
					- More fires burning continously on your side would mean more garbage 
				- [ ] Something that involves player movement on the board
					- Maybe something like [Combo Postage](https://kirklindsay.itch.io/combo-postage)?
					- Player could be crushed by blocks, but could do something to clear them
					- Blocks would increase in speed much more rapidly
				- [ ] Manipulating your garbage
					- [ ] Multi hole garbage
					- [ ] Garbage which requires some condition?
				- [ ] Something that requires you to both move pieces and a cursor
					- Maybe something like [Tetrisweeper](https://kertisjones.itch.io/tetrisweeper)? 
				- [ ] Something like [Scrabble Tetris](https://htwins.net/scrabbletetris/)?
					- Not sure if I like this one because i18n
				- [ ] Something unlike the other things mentioned
					- [Sandtris](https://sandtris.com/)
					- [Soft Body Tetris](https://newbie-indie-game-dev.itch.io/softbody-tetris)
			- [ ] Active abilities
				- By pressing the [Ability] key, these will be activated
				- Generally these require a charge meter of some sort, the specific action required will depend 
				- [x] Zone
				- [x] Filling holes
				- [ ] Changes your hold box into a special mino
					- [ ] Fairies, removes n lines of garbage 
					- [ ] Bomb, removes all tiles in an area
					- [ ] Sword, clears all minos in a direction
				- [ ] Send garbage to opponent but ... to you
					- [ ] Double back?
					- [ ] Unclearable garbage?
				- [ ] Breakout? Like ball and paddle, probably your piece becomes the paddle
		- [ ] Allows different players to play different gamemodes against each other, i.e. a duo and a tetra player
		- [ ] Players should be able to have loadouts of characters / active abilities
